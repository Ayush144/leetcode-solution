Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 
JAVA SOLUTION

class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
         int n=s.length();
        if(n==0){
            return true;
        }
          
        
        int k=0;
        for(int i=0;i<t.length();i++){
            if(t.charAt(i)==s.charAt(k)){
                k++;
            }
                
            
   
        if(k==s.length()){
       
        
        return true;
        }
            }
        return false;
    }
}
